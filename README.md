# Project 6
I created the functionality for a word guessing game. Used a list of phrases to populate the game, with a specific phrase chosen fron the list. The player has to choose the right letter in order to guess the phrase. I am going for an exceeds requirements grade.

## Features Include
1. Array created with 5 phrases in it.
2. A function selects a random phrase from the list and populates by letter into the display.
3. The player has to click on a letter to guess the correct letter in the phrase. If the letter is a match it will appear on the screen.
4. The player has 5 attempts to guess the correct letter.
5. If the player guesses all the letters then a Conragtulatory screen appears and ask if the would like to play again.
6. If the player runs out of attempts a screen appears telling them they lost and ask if they would like to play again.
7. If the button to play again is pressed, the board is cleared and a new phrase is selected to populate the display and start the game.
