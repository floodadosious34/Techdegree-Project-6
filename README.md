# Project 6
I added the JS code to create a web page that displays students pictures and inormation from an array with mulyiple objects, that have key:value pairs. I also added a search bar feature to search through the list and match the input to the search bar.

## Features Include
1. Function to add student info to page
2. A function to add corresponding page buttons at the bottom, allowing user to navigate through all the students in the list.
3. Dynamically input html to populate page with student info.
4. Added a search bar feature with JS and DOM manipulation
5. Created a function to match search bar input to first and last name in the array.
6. Added html to display a no result found message, if user does not find a match in their search.
